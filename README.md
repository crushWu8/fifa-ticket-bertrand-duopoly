## Project Overview

This repository contains code supporting the empirical and numerical analysis of price competition between the **FIFA official resale platform** and the **unofficial secondary market** within a static **Bertrand duopoly** framework. Using real transaction data, we estimate a **linear demand system** for both channels via data-driven calibration. Around the benchmark equilibrium prices, we introduce a deviation parameter $\delta \in [0, 0.5]$ to construct high-price and low-price ranges for each platform. For every value of $\delta$, the notebook evaluates revenues under four pricing regimes (combinations of high/low prices for the official and secondary markets). The resulting comparative statics visualize how each platform’s revenue responds to price deviations from equilibrium and how competitive advantage shifts between the two markets.
